## Reflection

This was a small project built for my job application. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point.

## Usage

1.  Drag pdf file over, or just click on big square with "Drag and drop here / Click to load" title and select pdf file

2.  If the pdf has more than two pages, click on two round buttons with arrows under the pages to navigate through the document

3.  If the document is not required size, it can be enlarged by pressing round button with plus "+" sign, or shrunk down by pressing the round button with minus "-" inside
